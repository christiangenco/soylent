# Hackerschool Soylent 1.0

This is a DIY soylent recipe [cross-posted from my food blog](http://www.cookingfor20.com/2013/06/18/hacker-school-soylent-recipe/). I'm putting it here for three reasons: 

0. Many programmers are interested in soylent.
0. Recipes benefit from version control, despite not being code.
0. I plan to flesh this out by adding JSON objects with nutritional data on ingredients in this recipe, and perhaps Ruby/Rails code to make it easier to develop future recipes.

## Safety

You should read the blog post before attempting this recipe, especially the "Safety" section.

## Recipe
### Ingredients (for 1 day, or 3 meals)

* 120 g oat flour
* 85 g soy protein from Trader Joe's, unflavored (see blog post for substitutions)
* 85 g olive oil
* 75 g brown sugar
* 25 g ground flax
* 20 g cocoa powder
* 15 g lecithin
* up to 10 g potassium citrate or 20 g potassium gluconate, added gradually (1 g per batch)
* 2 g iodized salt
* 1 g Emergen-C
* 3 Vitamin D supplements

### Method

0. Combine all dry ingredients except Vitamin D. Mix well.
0. Measure olive oil into a separate container.
0. To prepare an individual meal, measure about a third of the dry mix and a third of the oil into a large drinking vessel.
0. Add 400-500 ml (14-16 oz) of water, and shake or stir well.
0. Chill for several hours if possible, to improve taste and texture. It may be healthier that way too (due to phytic acid deactivation).
0. Take one Vitamin D tablet as directed and/or get some sunshine.
0. Drink.
